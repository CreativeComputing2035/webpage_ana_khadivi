# webpage_ana_khadivi

For this homeowork assignment I created a homepage for a portfolio based webpage. The 'about' and 'contact' links do not lead anywhere currently, but the first photo of the bag with the blue background leads to an example portfolio page with more photos of the project and a brief description. 

One question I have came across that I couldn't find an answer to was: is there a way to keep an element in the a fixed position when it's within a container without breaking the container? For example, I'd like to keep the projects title and description moving with the photos.
